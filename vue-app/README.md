# platform-templatevuesinglespa-pkg

## What is this template?

This project was generated from the `platform-templatevuesinglespa-pkg` repository. It is a template that utilises Vue CLI + single-spa and is designed to be the basis for any Vue based applications within IRIS.

In order to allow a developer to be successful when using Vue, this template sets up a number of Vue and JavaScript best practices. This includes the usage of Vue CLI which in turns allows for linting and unit testing. Because Vue CLI uses Babel, transpilation is already setup as well.

Additionally, single-spa has also been added allowing usage within the IRIS micro-frontend system.

As part of this template, an example set of routes and components are created for you. You can delete these.

## How to use this template?

The project name will need to be updated to the name of your new application in `package.json` as it is currently:

```json
{
  "name": "platform-templatevuesinglespa-pkg"
  ...
}
```

Once the following command has been performed to install `node_modules` then you are able to use the rest of the commands as shown:

### Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

## Styling

Vue CLI supports a number of CSS pre-processors out of the box. Additionally, this template has been setup to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The example components use this.

### Colour Palette

The IRIS design system palette has also been setup within the Tailwind configuration file.

The IRIS Figma design system is [available here](https://www.figma.com/file/InVkMn8AL9r3hCceiNMUWh/IRIS-Elements-UI-Kit?node-id=78%3A19).
